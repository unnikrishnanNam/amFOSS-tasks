## My experience

Each and every task I did gave me an unique experience . I was able to get a know-how on how most of the technologies out their work. Some of the tasks assigned was a bit tedious for me. But rather than complaining about those experiences,  I would like to thank everyone, who created these well structured tasks for us to play with.
### Installing Ubuntu:
Installing ubuntu wasn't a hard task for me. It could be because I had experience in installing different OS on the computer. But it doesn't mean that the flow was smooth. Even i got few errors which scared me for a moment. More on the errors I got is in the Task-00 folder
### Star all the amFOSS repositories
Starring all the amFOSS repositories was the most easiest task. I was able to complete this task in no time. Still i went through the code 
### Terminal Hunt
This task was a bit confusing for me at first, but I was able to complete the entire task within a day. This task did actually helped me a lot in memorizing the linux terminal commands. I was also exposed to new commands which i was not familiar about.
### Programming
This was the task which took most of my time. Still I would say it was worth it. Some tasks made my day happier,  while other made it worst. Still i was able to complete those somehow.
### CineBot
Cine bot was a really interesting project to work on as it was more applicable in the real world. It was my first time working with pytelegrambotapi, but after playing with it for a while I started to love it. I hope I will be able to make it more practical by implementing this for other projects also
### Find The Bug
Even though this challenge was easy for most of people out their, I struggled a bit for this one. It was my first time working with .net, sockets, c# etc. But after going through few of the blogs, i was able to finish it.
### Flame Game
Flame game was a bit of a different experience for me. It could be because I'm already familiar with flutter and now I just needed to learn the flame. But then the flame docs weren't  that useful. So i had to learn from other sources which was not well structured. But other than that everything else was fine. I didn't got any errors or anything which was a good thing.
### GO WASM
GO and WASM, both are awesome technologies if used properly. now that's something I understood while doing this task. I really love the way go is able to deliver such a high performance while keeping its syntax simple. I learned few of the basic concepts of Golang so that I won't be having issue while working with WASM
### Internet Explorer
I would say this was the most easiest task in this entire list. First, i was already familiar with web development. I had experience in developing websites. So this was just like a hair in my skin. Also at some point i realized i could simply use the developer option to get the entire source code.
### Krypto Scrapper
This was a really interesting project mostly because of the future possibilities of projects like this. I had to face few troubles while learning the rust lang, mostly because of its strict syntax. The scrapper crate was actually easy to learn and work with thanks to the well structured documentation. 
### CS50
I watched the cs50 lectures before going to the week set. The problem was i didn't had enough time to complete the tasks so I kept it for at last. But I failed to complete it on time.
### Figma Ninja
Figma ninja was a really interesting and a refreshing task for me as UI designing is one my favorite task. Because i didn't had enough time, i was just speedrunning through the task. So it is not as good as I thought it would be
