## A not so boaring counter created using WASM and GO

This project was a new experience for me as this was my first time working with GOlang and wasm.
I got chance to learn about web assembly which i felt was a really interesting concept.
I always wanted to create web apps uing other languages otherthan js.
I had to face few troubles in the installation phase. But then google came to me with the answer.
After learning all the important topics in GO which was required for the wasm, I Started refereing to few of the blogs related to wasm.
One phase i was stuck in for a long time was in the DOM manipulation.
Finally after reading thorugh different blogs and docs, i completed.
