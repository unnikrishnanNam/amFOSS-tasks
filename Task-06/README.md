# My Game, Flame Game

This was the second most difficult task for me.
Even after working in flutter for 3 months, i found the flame package a bit difficult to learn and understand.
One of the main reason was the lack of good quality resources and well structured documentation.
So i had to take help from one of my friends
With the help of few of my friends, i did complete it.
