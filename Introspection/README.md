# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I was tech enthusiast from the time remember. My interests where really into motors and circuits. It grown to a point i started to play with arduino boards and raspberry pi. It was then i came to know about programming languages like c++ and c. I learned those languages when i was in 7th grade. I even got chance to not just participate for the inter-school science fair, but to get 1st and hold the medal for 2 yrs. I always wanted to grow my knowledge about programming, so I was always in the search of new technologies. I even did freelancing for an organization known as Dr Muralis Medical Centre. The journey was amazing but I know that I only knew very few things and need to learn a lot. Amfoss will be surely help me in the learning process and I feel that amFoss can think of choosing me on the basis of my eager to learn and explore in this field. I love developing things that can be used and make other life better.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?


## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will do whatever I can. The concept of learn in public fascinates me alot. Amfoss club is the best way to do that and I will do whatever I can to contribute back to this club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
My feedback is just "WOW". The way we all are introduced, group names with planets , discord server, tasks, meetings and the mentors is just amazing. The steepest learning curve I have till the date.
