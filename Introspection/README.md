# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I was tech enthusiast from the time remember. My interests where really into motors and circuits. It grown to a point i started to play with arduino boards and raspberry pi. It was then i came to know about programming languages like c++ and c. I learned those languages when i was in 7th grade. I even got chance to not just participate for the inter-school science fair, but to get 1st and hold the medal for 2 yrs. I always wanted to grow my knowledge about programming, so I was always in the search of new technologies. I even did freelancing for an organization known as Dr Muralis Medical Centre. The journey was amazing but I know that I only knew very few things and need to learn a lot. Amfoss will be surely help me in the learning process and I feel that amFoss can think of choosing me on the basis of my eager to learn and explore in this field. I love developing things that can be used and make other life better.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
One important lesson I learned while doing this task was, learning is a endless path and you should always be in an attitude to learn new things every moment. I really wanted to dedicate my next few months in learning more about software development and also software marketing. One thing I noticed while doing the tasks was that I am not good in competitive programming. I will invest my time in improving my skills and I would also like to contribute to open-source projects so that I can have a much bigger view of what I will be facing in the future.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
As I wrote earlier in the other sections, I would really love to be a part of such a great team of devs and work on the projects for the club. I will also be helping juniors and colleagues in attaining their goals. I will also 

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
If I would have to say the feedback in a single word, It would be "AWESOME". The main reason reason why say that is because I feel, every software developer should be having a know-how on how everything works. Even though its not that deep, this knowledge always helps a developer.
